\section{Configuring and Compiling ISSM} \label{sec:troubleshooting-compiling-issm}
\subsection*{ld: library not found for -lflapack}
If you get the following error: \lstinlinebg|ld: library not found for -lflapack| (generally happens on macOS), remove the line \lstinlinebg|--with-blas-lapack-dir| from your configuration and try compiling again.

\subsection*{ld: file not found: @rpath/<LIBRARY\_NAME>.dylib for architecture <ARCH>}
If you get a variation of the above error on macOS (where \lstinlinebg|<LIBRARY_NAME>| is a version of `libquadmath' or `libgcc'), you need to add the path to the GFortran libraries to your shell configuration file.

If you installed GFortran via FX Coudert's GitHub repository, you should add,
\begin{lstlisting}
export LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/gfortran/lib:${LIBRARY_PATH}"
\end{lstlisting}

If you installed GFortran via Homebrew, you should add,
\begin{lstlisting}
export LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/<VER>/lib/gcc/current:${LIBRARY_PATH}"
\end{lstlisting}
