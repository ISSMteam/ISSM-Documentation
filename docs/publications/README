This directory contains scripts and other resources for generating publication references formatted for inclusion on the for inclusion in the online ISSM documentation (`https://issmteam.github.io/ISSM-Documentation/publications`).

## Instructions
`./doi/` contains a series of text files that are named after years. Each of files contains a series of DOI's, one per line, that correspond to publications from that year.
- To add a new DOI, paste it to a new line in the file corresponding to the year in which the article was published.
- To add a new year, create a new text file that follows the above protocol.

IMPORTANT: These files *must* end with a blank line in order to be parsed correctly.

- It is good practice to check locally before committing that all DOI's in a file are unique. One way to do this is,
````
tempfile=$(mktemp)
cat -n ./doi/<year> | sort -uk2 | sort -nk1 | cut -f2- > ${tempfile}
yes | mv ${tempfile} ./doi/<year>
````
- After adding a new DOI or year, commit the changes to the repository.
- A workflow (`../../.github/workflows/publications.sh`) will generate a new page (`./index.md`) for inclusion in the online ISSM documentation (`https://issmteam.github.io/ISSM-Documentation/publications`).

### Local Use
From a local copy of this directory, run,
````
./bin/generate_publications_page.sh
````
to markup for the ISSM Documentation 'Publications' page.

To generate markup for all of the DOI's, run,
````
./bin/issm_pub_list.sh
````

DOI's for a single year or a collection of years can be generated with,
````
./bin/issm_pub_list.sh YEAR [YEAR ... YEAR]
````
where YEAR is any of the files in `./doi/`.

Single DOI entries can be generated with,
````
./bin/doi_to_issm_website_markup.sh <DOI>
````

Output can be redirected to a file as needed.
