The 2025 ISSM Workshop will take place at Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, USA, March 19th to 21st, 2025.

We are pleased to announce that registration is now open for the 2025 Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) Workshop. There is no fee for participation in the workshop. A limited amount of travel support may be provided by Dartmouth’s Changing Polar Regions Academic cluster to help students or early-career scholars attend the workshop. Tutorials and interactive sessions will be offered for beginners/advanced users and developers interested in learning how to use ISSM. The workshop will be in-person and will cover both ice sheet dynamics and solid-Earth/Sea level fingerprints. We hope the workshop generates fruitful interactions between our team, the growing community of ISSM users, and the broader cryosphere community.

The workshop is sponsored by Dartmouth’s Changing Polar Regions Academic cluster, and NASA’s Earth Surface and Interior, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change Team Programs.
